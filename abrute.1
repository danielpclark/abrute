.SH NAME
abrute \- Multi-threaded AES Brute Force File Decryption
.SH SYNOPSIS
abrute <RANGE> <CHARACTERS> [OPTIONS] -- <TARGET>
.SH DESCRIPTION
Multi-threaded AES Brute Force File Decryption
.SH OPTIONS
<RANGE>         Single digit or a range 4:6 for password length.
.PP
<CHARACTERS>    Characters to use in password attempt. Don't use quotes
                unless they may be in the password. Backslash may escape
                characters such as space.
.PP
-a, --adjacent  Set a limit for allowed adjacent characters. Zero will
                not allow any characters of the same kind to neighbor
                in the attempts.
.PP
-s, --start     Starting character sequence to begin with.
.PP
-z, --zip       Use `unzip` decryption instead of `aescrypt`.
.PP
-c, --chunk     Workload chunk size per core before status update.
                Defaults to 32.
.PP
--cluster       Takes an offset and cluster size such as 1:4 for the
                first system in a cluster of 4.  Helps different systems
                split the workload without trying the same passwords.
.PP
-r, --reporter  Use `spinner`, or `benchmark` to use a different command
                line reporter.
.PP
<TARGET>        Target file to decrypt.  The target must be preceeded
                by a double dash: -- target.aes
.PP
-h, --help      Prints help information.
.PP
-v, --version   Prints version information.

Decrypts a file with a range of 4, characters of 1234, and a target path to the
example.file.aes

abrute 4 1234 -- example.file.aes

Decrypts a file with a range of 4, characters of 1234, an option of beginning
with a character sequence of 2222, and a target path to the example.file.aes
